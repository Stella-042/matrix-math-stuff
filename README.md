# matrix-math-stuff
this program does matrix math using a system for numbers that allows the use of unknowns and gives presice readout in the form of fractions

the "Program" file is a sandbox where you can play with the matrixes and fractions

it uses opperator overloading so you can use normal arithmatic
some functions will work regardless and the ones that may not be possible will return a bool and out the value

bool sucess = A.function(out B);
